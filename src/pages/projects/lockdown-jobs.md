## Job loss

Losing a job is hard specially if you have mouths to feed. Specially if its unexpected. Been there before. But all glory to God. He never leave me, He never forsake me. He even blessed me and my family.

### What's this about?

Lockdown Jobs is my second entry to #NoCodeConnectsUs challenge powered by Adalo.

It aims to crowdsource jobs. It doesn't matter how big or small it is, as long as it can be done online and at home, that would be really helpful. Specially for those who unexpectedly lose their jobs because of COVID-19 virus.

### How does it work?

Simple.

**Job seekers don't need to signup or login.** Job openings are immediately displayed and refreshed as new job arise. This is to help the job seekers to apply for the job as fast as possible.

**Job makers need to signup or login to be able to post jobs.**

### What kind of jobs should I post?

For example, if you own a business and there's a job to maintain your social media page. Maybe it wouldn't hurt if you make it a job opening for 2 hours a day that costs $5 per hour. Not bad isn't it? This is until the job seeker finds a better and sustainable job in the future.

Do you have a job to share during this time of pandemic?
