## What is this about?

[**Wisdom**](https://seekfirst.adalo.com/wisdom) is an app that aims to teach us the value of life. That our life here on earth is short. So what we do with our life really matters.

The app has a simple calculator functionality.

It will ask for the user's current age.

Multiply the current age by \~365 days to get how many days the user have lived.

Given that we might only live for 70 years or \~25,550 days.

25,550 days minus the numbers of days the user lived results to the number of days left to enjoy life.

## Why build Wisdom?

I was just browsing through my email and saw this challenge from [**Adalo**](https://www.adalo.com/) called the [**#NoCodeConnectsUs**](https://www.nucode.co/challenge/the-nocodeconnectsus-challenge-1585655164419x599472269787660300). The goal is to build web apps using their platform and could possibly win a lifetime access to their wonderful no-code platform.

I shared [**Adalo**](https://www.adalo.com/product) to my wife and she got pretty excited because it's a no-code platform. I encouraged her to learn and watch videos from [**Adalo**](https://www.adalo.com/learn).

That same evening, we started jotting down rough ideas and out of 40 items, one of those is [**Wisdom**](https://seekfirst.adalo.com/wisdom).
