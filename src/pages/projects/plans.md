> Good planning and hard work lead to prosperity, but hasty shortcuts lead to poverty. - **Proverbs 21:5 NLT**

## Looking back...

It's been a while since I made another no-code app.

I've totally lost the desire and motivation even though the no-code ecosystem has been very generous to help non-coders to create.

But one day, I stumbled upon [Glideapps](https://www.glideapps.com/) again and I'm amazed at how it grew it's functionalities in one year.

## What happened?

I played around and took the time to learn [Glideapps](https://www.glideapps.com/learn-to-glide).

I also discovered their [Templates](https://www.glideapps.com/templates) kind of like a marketplace.

Then I tried building a church template app.

However, it's not yet finished until now but I had the feel of what it's like in building a Glide app.

## What's next?

The next thing I did was a simple to do list app.

It went through several cycles and name change until finally, [Plans](https://plans.glideapp.io/) was born.

I've submitted it as a template in Glide and is now approved!

It's a FREE planning template app to help us keep track of our tasks.

Plus, it has insights that can help us understand more about our progress.

And last but not the least, we can rate individual task of how much we love what we do. ðŸ’™
