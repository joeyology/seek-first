# The Gist

For the first time in my life, I have shared the gist of this app in this twitter thread ðŸ‘‰[https://twitter.com/goseekfirst/status/1296849793499582465](https://buyers.glideapp.io/ "https://buyers.glideapp.io/").

# In a Nutshell

I am really looking for a lot to buy here in Davao City, Philippines.

And basically, the usual process is to open and search in Facebook Marketplace.

That's where I found this house that we are renting at the moment.

# However...

I noticed and asked, why is this the usual process?

Can this be done the other way around?

Like the seller will find the buyer.

# Tada!

Immediately, I started drafting the Value Proposition Canvas followed by the Business Model Canvas.

In my head, if I can be able to write this idea down on paper then there's a chance!

True enough, I was able to finish both canvases and started working in Glide right away.

# Challenge...

However, I don't have that much practice.

The latest Glide App that I did before this was an app the can copy and paste a letter that is not in the keyboard ([http://tilde.glideapp.io/](https://buyers.glideapp.io/ "https://buyers.glideapp.io/")) !

# Buy Me A Coffee â˜•

After several iterations, finding a way on how the seller could contact the buyer.

I ended up with this brilliant idea that if the seller badly needed to contact a certain buyer, why not buy the buyer a coffee. Boom!

But seriously, I just really don't know how to go about it and that's my best shot!
