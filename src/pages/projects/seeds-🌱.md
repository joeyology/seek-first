## What is Seeds ðŸŒ±?

[**Seeds**](https://seekfirst.adalo.com/seeds) is highly inspired by the full story of the [**Parable of the Talents**](https://dailydevotion.app/tabs/bible/ENGESVN2ET/Matt/25) in the bible. It's a parable taught by our Lord Jesus about being a good steward of the blessings that God has given us based on our abilities.

The principle behind the story has become famous in financial education.

**4 Easy steps (with 4 sub steps):**

1. Enter your seeds (or the money / source of your income).
2. The app will calculate the following:
   1. Tithes (based on 10%) = Seeds x 10%
   2. Income is what's left after giving the tithes.
   3. Investment (based on 20%) = Income x 20%, the money you can use for investment
   4. Balance is what's left less the investment, the basis for expenses.
3.  Check the balance and enter your desired amount to spend in the expenses.
4. Check how much is left for your savings and if you are happy with it, click Plant Seeds to save it.
