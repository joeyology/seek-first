## Why make another Bible app?

In our time today, most people don't have the desire or interest in studying and reading the Word of God. I say this because out of my \~15 co-workers that I've invited to join my Bible Study, no one even bother. Zero.

So why still make another Bible App?

Because the Bible says, there are remnants. In this messy yet beautiful earth, I am not the only one who loves reading the Bible. There will always be people that God calls and will adopt to be part of His Kingdom.

So yeah, I have hope.

Now, let's dig down deeper and see if this idea is worth pursuing in 3 Ps.

### Problem

Our brain's memory is limited. Thus, we tend to forget. Sometimes even the most important thing in our life.

Also, we don't know when will God speak to us as we read His Word. To give us divine revelation or instruction on what decision and action we need to make in our life.

Hence, how can we be able to be ready and prepared when that moment comes?

### Proposed Solution

Why not make a way to be able to write down our thoughts as we do our quiet time or daily devotions?

Does it make sense?

Let's add a deeper sense of purpose.

### Purpose

Daily Devotion is a tool that aims to help Christians during their quiet time or daily devotion to write down their thoughts immediately as they read the Bible and meditate on the Word of God.

## How does it work?

[Daily Devotion](https://dailydevotion.app/) is a (PWA) progressive web app. Wait, what is that? It is just basically a website but with super powers. How is that? When you open it on your mobile browser, it will look and feel like as if it is an app! Amazing, isn't it?

So that's my lame take on trying to explain a progressive web app.

But here's an in depth article from [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) to learn more about PWA.
