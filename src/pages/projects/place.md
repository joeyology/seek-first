# What's in a Place?

If you have noticed, I'm just trying to get the very basic word that I is available in Glide sub-domains.

And "place" is available so I grabbed it!

# Too much hassle & risk!

During this lockdown, I had a terrible experience with our internet provider.

It's been a month of intermittent connections.

And worst, no connection at all.

It affects my productivity.

It put me and my wife at risk because we don't have a choice but to go to a coffee shop just for us to get to work.

And there are times that I needed to do a long drive just to work in the office.

# What's the Idea?

I'm not sure if Airbnb has this already because why not?! They already have the platform.

But this is pretty much like Airbnb but only for a limited time and space.

The key is the internet. This is part of what the guest will pay for.

# The problem?

Internet and Productivity.

No internet connection at home.

And not being productive at home anymore.

# The solution!

For the guest, a nice place or space with internet connection where we can be productive.

For the host, a nice way to earn extra during this pandemic.

# Requirements?

The host must have an internet connection.

The host can offer other services or add-on as competitive advantage.

The host can only offer an hourly rate because this is intended only during working/studying period.

# How does it work?

2 simple steps!

1. The guest searches a place.
2. If OK, contact the host. Else, continue searching.

That's it!

No reservation management yet.

So its up to the host for now.
