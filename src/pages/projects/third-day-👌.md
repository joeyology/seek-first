## What's in a name?

I got the name from [**Luke 13:32**](https://dailydevotion.app/tabs/bible/ENGESVN2ET/Luke/13) where Jesus says that He will reach His goal on the third day. But behind that name is a principle that can help us effectively achieve our goals and be productive.

## What's the principle?

The principle to learn from this story is that we have to calendar our goals. 

_For example, Jesus' goal is to go to Jerusalem._

_Jesus breaks down His goal into 3 days:_

_Today - I will drive out demons and heal people_

_Tomorrow - I will do the same thing on my way_

_Third day - I will reach my goal_

Productivity, Jesus way!

And that's how exactly Third Day App works! ðŸ‘Œ
