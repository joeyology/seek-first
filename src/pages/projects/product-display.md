> But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.”

It's amazing how looks can make a big difference cause we are truly visual by nature. To add more context here, it affects how I look at this website of mine. Because the images are not so great, I'm not that motivated to keep on improving it. That's my problem.

## What's the problem?

My problem is that, the images on my website's portfolio isn't great for me. I'm not really happy when I'm opening it. Even me loses this thing called Customer Experience.

And this is all about solving my problem at the same time have an entry for the #NoCodeConnectsUs Challenge by Adalo. Yeah. :)

### What's the solution?

Adalo's WebView Component helps me with the idea. And I'm amaze by how easy and simple the component to use. I just wish that it has a built in feature for a mobile frame. It took me some time to find this beautiful rose gold iPhone 6 image.

Anyhow, the solution is to display the product on the mobile frame by entering the product's URL. Add the product name and a killer tagline. That's it! Simple and sweet!

Wait! Now, take a screenshot! And you're good to go!
