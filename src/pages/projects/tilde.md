# Why?

Of all the app ideas out there, why make an app that just copy and paste the letters (wait... I need to open this app to get them) Ã± or Ã‘?

Because I need it.

My last name is TaleÃ±o and I have lived the pain of not having this letter in the keyboard all my life!

# That is why...

And suddenly, out of the blue, I opened Glide and hack away.

After maybe 15 or 20 minutes, it's out in the world! ðŸš€
