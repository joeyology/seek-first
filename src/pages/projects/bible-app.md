## What makes this another Bible app special?

To be honest, nothing.

There are lots of amazing Bible apps out there.

However, for us this is special.

We can never be here today without God and His Word.

We owe everything to Jesus!

This is our five loaves and two fishes and let God feed the five thousand. â™¥
