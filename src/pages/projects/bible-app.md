## What makes this another Bible app special?

To be honest, nothing.

There are lots of amazing Bible apps out there.

However, for us this is special.

We can never be here today without God and His Word.

We owe everything to Jesus!

This is our five loaves and two fishes and let God feed the five thousand. â™¥

## What can you do with it?

The [**Bible App**](www.bibleapp.pro) has 2 major features:

### Read

![](/images/bible_demo_1.gif)

Currently, we can read the English Standard Version (ESV) only. God willing we can be able to make it more dynamic and extend it to other Bible translations.

However, the best part is, we can read the Bible for FREE!

### Write

![](/images/bible_demo_2.gif)

We believe that there are lovers of the Word out there that also loves to write. They are even writing directly in their Bibles for we never know when a great revelation will come.

With the [**Bible App**](www.bibleapp.pro), it allows people to not just to write their thoughts on the go but also to upload a photo that best describes the idea.

Plus, we allow people to just keep things in private if they want. But we also give them the opportunity to publish their thoughts in [**Devotions**](devotions.bibleapp.pro). And let other people be blessed by their devotionals.
