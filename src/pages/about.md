## Our Principle

> But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
>
> [**Matthew 6:33 ESV**](https://dailydevotion.app/tabs/bible/ENGESVN2ET/Matt/6)

**We believe that as we seek God first and make His righteousness our priority, He will provide everything we need.**

## Our Identity

> God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure.
>
> **Ephesians 1:5 NLT**

**We are adopted children of God through Jesus Christ!**

## Our Purpose

> And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.
>
> **Matthew 6:13 NKJV**

**To give God all the glory in everything we do!**
