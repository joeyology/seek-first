> 31 “You have heard the law that says, ‘A man can divorce his wife by merely giving her a written notice of divorce.’ 32 But I say that a man who divorces his wife, unless she has been unfaithful, causes her to commit adultery. And anyone who marries a divorced woman also commits adultery.

> Matthew 5:31-32 NLT

## Where is the love?

I'm having a hard time expressing my thoughts here.

Why? Is it because this is about divorce?

Somewhat yes.

So I think I'll just focus around understanding more on what Jesus says.

For me, I think the reason why Jesus raised the bar higher when it comes to divorce is because it is not good for us and He really cares for our hearts.

> Since they are no longer two but one, let no one split apart what God has joined together.” Matthew 19:6 NLT

The reason why people decided to get married is because of love.

And I think God is very happy and loves it so much that He even made two different people to be one forever.

Which is the total opposite of divorce.

Jesus says, if it's due to unfaithfulness so be it but otherwise don't.

And don't marry someone who got divorced.

It's like trying to deconstruct a house.

It can be done but all the pieces can be damaged or even be broken, almost good for nothing.

Yes some parts may be reused for another house but it is not as strong as brand new. It could tear apart and won't last that long.

So no matter how delicate the issue may be, stand up for what is right.

And that's where I found real love in Jesus. 💖
