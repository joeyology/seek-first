# Where Is The Love?

I'm pretty sure that there is love in this passage but I just cannot find the right terminology.

Isn't it hard to do something or to do something for someone that we don't love?

Or sometimes we still do the things we do but not in loving way anymore.

In this passage, I see the love when Jesus said "It should be done...".

Yes, God getting water baptized.

For me, Jesus has all the more reason to not do water baptism because He is God Himself.

He designed and created water baptism for us to do, His children.

But regardless of His identity and position, Jesus chose to show love through humility.

There is no pride in God.

It blows my mind to realize how much great things we can do if we will not allow pride to get in the way.

# What Would Have Been?

As a Christian, it would be hard for me to do the Great Commission if I think highly of myself than other people.

As a Husband, it would be hard for me to help my wife do the house chores if I think that I am the provider in the family and I don't deserve to do lowly tasks.

As soon to be Father, it would be hard for me to say to our kids how much I love them if I will think that they should be the one telling me that they love me.

As a Data Architect (at the moment of this writing), it would be hard for me to do documentations, helping other colleagues do things that seems easy for me but hard for them if I think of myself in much higher position than they are.

As the President of Wired Professionals Fellowship in our church, it would be very hard for me to call and pray for people if I think of myself that it's not my job to this these things.

# I Have Found Love

I think my mission to found Jesus' Love in this passage is accomplished.

I need to love myself by being humble by not thinking about my place and position in life and by not giving pride a chance to enter my heart.

Through Jesus' example and by the grace of God, we can do greater things in humility and love!
