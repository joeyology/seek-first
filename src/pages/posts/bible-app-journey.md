## What happened?

As you know from my previous blogs and "product" posts in this site, I am obviously hustling in the #NoCodeConnectsUs Challenge by Adalo.

During my first week, I was able to submit 4 entries for the contest which I'm surprised. Of course they are not that amazing to you, but for they are wonderful web apps to me. 

I've never build as fast as that in my life ever. Truly Adalo gave us a super power!

### Then what?

Then on the 2nd week, I got super busy at work that I can't find time to work on new web apps. But thankfully, I was still able to pull 2 apps during that weekend.

And on the third week, I don't know what to build anymore.

### My last entry...

My eyes are on the prize. I am focused. I really want the lifetime access to Adalo so bad. And I only have 1 idea left.

A Bible app.

Something that I am really passionate about because it is supernatural.

And I really believe that God's Word is the greatest weapon that we have to fight the effects of this pandemic in our lives.

And so I build my last entry and submitted it to Nucode.

Only God knows what will happen from there.

There are lots of amazing entries that even though it seems like I have lots of entries, the other apps as just brilliant.

## Enjoy!
