# Where Is The Love?

Education is part of our system for a very long time.

Hence, I normally just see teaching as another kind of profession.

However, I realized from this passage that teaching is not just.

It is a privilege.

It is a way of loving people.

Jesus is a teacher and He loves people by teaching.
