## Adalo gave me super powers?!

Yes. That's somewhat the gist of [**Adalo**](https://www.adalo.com/)'s email few days ago. I got hooked by the subject so I kept on reading. And there, I've discovered that they have a new challenge called "The [**#NoCodeConnectsUs**](https://www.nucode.co/challenge/the-nocodeconnectsus-challenge-1585655164419x599472269787660300) Challenge".

### What's the challenge?

Basically, we need to make apps using the amazing no-code platform of [**Adalo**](https://www.adalo.com/our-story) and submit the project to a no-code community called [**Nucode**](https://www.nucode.co/).

However, it is again a challenge.

The challenge is to make something that can help people connect due to the social distancing effect of the COVID-19 virus.

### What's in it for us?

We could have a chance to win a lifetime access to [**Adalo Pro**](https://www.adalo.com/pricing)!

Sounds good eh?!
