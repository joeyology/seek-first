> 27 â€œYou have heard the commandment that says, â€˜You must not commit adultery.â€™ 28 But I say, anyone who even looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart. Matthew 5:27-28 NLT

## Where is the love?

Sorry but truth is, there is no love in sin.

In this example, Jesus raises the bar higher when it comes to committing adultery.

Jesus said, just by looking at a person with lust, we are already committing adultery in our hearts.

And that's where I found how Jesus loves us so much.

Jesus really cares about the condition of our hearts.

Based from my personal experience, I find it really hard to give and show genuine love when my heart is full of lust.

A person who loves will raise the bar higher just to keep us from harm.

A person who does not love does otherwise.

Thank you, Jesus, for teaching us how to keep our hearts safe from harm. ðŸ’–
