excerpt: Based from my experience, this is so true. It's very easy to start something.
  And it's very hard to finish it. But the Bible says, finishing is better than starting.
  So let's not be deceived if we think "Wow! I've already started this thing and that
  business!". The main question is, "Is it finished?".

Based from my experience, this is so true. It's very easy to start something. And it's very hard to finish it. But the Bible says, finishing is better than starting. So let's not be deceived if we think "Wow! I've already started this thing and that business!". The main question is, "Is it finished?".

## 2018

It was around September 2018 when an unexpected storm came. Me and my colleagues got offered to leave the company. Business decision they say. But then I'm grateful because I know God is with us always.

While looking for another job, I taught myself to build a web app. I stumbled upon Flask, a micro service web framework built in Python. With the help of a Udemy Course, I was able to build the very first version of Daily Devotion hosted on a free Heroku platform.

Was this finished? No.

## 2019

God blessed me with a new job. A promotion from my previous one. With a relocation package. God's been good! However, I really want to build something but I'm not a web developer. I just keep on searching until I stumbled upon Anvil, another platform that allows non-hardcore web developers to build web apps with nothing but Python.

They have a free tier of their platform with the privilege to use pretty much most of the functionality needed to build a decent web app. The only requirement is a knowledge in Python and we can crack on. Fast forward, I was able to build a better version of Daily Devotion. However, I was able to use it for just a few months. I lost the joy in using it.

Was it finished? Semi.

## 2020

I still have the same job by the grace of God. And I've learned loyalty during my tenure. Our team are blessed to have a limited access to LinkedIn Learning. The very first thing that I've searched was an Ionic Framework training. I stumbled upon this Ionic 4.0 Essential Training by Sani Yusuf.

I've been actually following Ionic Framework's journey since the beginning but due to my limited web development skills, I wasn't able to make even one decent working app. However, through Sani's course, I was able to follow and build the newest version of Daily Devotion, now a progressive web app built in Ionic 5.

Is this finished? Not yet. But I'm using it for my Daily Devotion.

God willing, I hope to finish it. Will keep you posted!
