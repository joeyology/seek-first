> 21 “You have heard that our ancestors were told, ‘You must not murder. If you commit murder, you are subject to judgment.’ 22 But I say, if you are even angry with someone, you are subject to judgment! If you call someone an idiot, you are in danger of being brought before the court. And if you curse someone, you are in danger of the fires of hell. Matthew 5:21-22 NLT

## Where Is The Love?

Committing murder is beyond extreme.

But getting angry at someone, like saying bad things and even curses about and to the person seems a typical moment in our life.

However, for Jesus, both are equal even the first one seems more extreme than the latter.

Both are subject to judgment and are in danger of the fires of hell.

To be clear, we can be angry. 

But I think this kind of anger is towards a person that we have heaviness and bitterness in our hearts.

Hence, curses come out because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

> And “don’t sin by letting anger control you.” Don’t let the sun go down while you are still angry, Ephesians 4:26 NLT

We are humans and are emotional beings.

We can become angry.

But in anger, don't sin by letting our hearts be controlled by hate and bitterness.

Instead, be angry at sin and love the person. 💖
