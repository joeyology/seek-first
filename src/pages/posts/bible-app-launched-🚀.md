## What happened yesterday?!

So yes.

I was just researching on how to [**launch in Product Hunt**](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/bible) yesterday and then suddenly.

Poof! I unexpectedly launched our first ever product called [**Bible app**](www.bibleapp.pro)!

### What's next?

So it's out there now.

And it's not doing really good as of this post.

But by faith, we can only give our five loaves and two fishes.

And let God feed the five thousand. â™¥
