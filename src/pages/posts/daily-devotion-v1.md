## Start

I was actually been following Ionic Framework since it's version 1. I even subscribed to Ionic Creator because I'm really not a hardcore programmer. Then it went on to v2, v3, v4 and I still can't make it work.

Then suddenly, [Anvil](https://anvil.works/) came into the picture with a very bold declaration, "Built nothing but Python". I'm reminded. I have a little bit of Python skills in me from over a year of building Airflow DAGs. So I jumped in and built the very first version of the [Daily Devotion app](https://daily-devotion.anvil.app/).

## In Between

I was actually happy because this was the first time that I made a working web app. And it's built nothing but Python. Compared to other web frameworks I tried and built nothing.

I really love using my app. I actually have my daily devotions saved there. Until such time that I'm not using it anymore. And I'm not updating the app anymore. All because of the user interface. I really don't like how I can't make the look and feel the way I want it to be.

## End

[Anvil](https://anvil.works/) is really a wonderful framework for building web apps, specially if Python is your favorite language. So it's not Anvil's fault, it's me and my buggy attitude. I want to build something beautiful with less effort on me because I'm not a designer.

I give [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) another shot and this time it's already in v5. I rebuild my [Daily Devotion app](https://dailydevotion.app/tabs/tab1) and true enough, it's pretty. Specially, when used on an Apple device. 🍎
