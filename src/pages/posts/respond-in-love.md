> 'During that time the devil came and said to him, ‚ÄúIf you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.‚Äù But Jesus told him, ‚ÄúNo! The Scriptures say, ‚ÄòPeople do not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.‚Äù' Matthew 4:3-4

# Where Is The Love?

As we live in this world, there will always be temptations.

And as I meditate on this passage, I realized that temptations give us an opportunity to show love.

Looking at how Jesus face temptation, He took this opportunity to show whom He really love by responding with the Word of God.

It sure is not loving to the devil but it is lovely to God.

# Principle To Learn

In times of temptations, we respond in love by echoing every word that comes from the mouth of God.

# Application

We cannot give what we don't have.

We cannot respond in love if we don't have the Word of God in our hearts.

Hence, we do not live by taking care of our physical bodies alone.

We also need to live by feeding our soul and Spirit by reading the Bible everyday.
