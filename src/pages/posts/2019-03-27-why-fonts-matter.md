## The Journey Begins

Yes. It always begin this way. However, several times now since 10 years ago.

I always start something but never did my dream to have a software company materialized. Sad.

### In the Beginning

Way back years ago, I had kept a Word of God during my daily devotion. 

It was from [Numbers 9:15-23](https://dailydevotion.app/tabs/tab1/ENGESVO2ET/Num/ENGESVO2ET/Num/9).

The story is telling me not to move unless God moves as well. I thought, yeah, that was a great idea and I decided to call my first solo attempt side project as The Fiery Cloud. Which is the title of the story in New Living Translation.

And it didn't move. ⛈ #NothingHappen

### Another New Beginning

Fast forward, 5 years since, here I am again. 

Trying to make another new beginning.

But this time, it's different.

### Another Word from God

I received another Word from God that speaks right into my heart.

It's from [Matthew 6:33](https://dailydevotion.app/tabs/tab1/ENGESVN2ET/Matt/ENGESVN2ET/Matt/6).

It tells me not to seek what could be the next big idea that will hit. 

But instead, God tells me, to seek Him first and His righteousness. Then this desire deep down in my heart, to have my own software related company, will be added to my life. And many other desires.

### Ending

And that's how I got the name of [my future company](https://seekfirst.netlify.com/).
