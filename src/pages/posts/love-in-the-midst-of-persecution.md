> 'â€œGod blesses you when people mock you and persecute you and lie about you and say all sorts of evil things against you because you are my followers. Be happy about it! Be very glad! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember, the ancient prophets were persecuted in the same way.' Matthew 5:11-12 NLT

## Where Is The Love?

Jesus knew that following Him is not a walk in the park.

Believers and followers of Christ will experience mocking and persecution from people.

I can't feel any love in that.

However, Jesus see it differently.

Jesus says, we should be happy and be very glad about it!

Wait... what? How?

When we are fully convinced that we will have a great reward that is waiting for us in heaven.

When we remember that even the ancient prophets were also persecuted in the same way.

And I realized that there is love in the midst of persecution.

God is there for us and gives us assurance of a blessed life in heaven.
