> 'From then on Jesus began to preach, ‚ÄúRepent of your sins and turn to God, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near.‚Äù' Matthew 4:17

# Where Is The Love?

Before I got saved, I know I have sins.

But I am just taking it lightly.

Because no one dared to confront me about my sins.

Until my time has come.

When God moved and linked me to His children.

Someone has to be bold enough to share God's love for me and my need to deal with my sins.

Yes it was offensive.

That's why we are afraid and don't bother sharing it.

But Jesus is different.

He began to preach a message that will offend people, to repent of their sins and turn to God.

But in the end, the real message is love.

# Principle To Learn

The truth is, not telling people to repent from sins and turn to God is actually not loving them.

We really love when we follow and do Jesus' way.

# Application

I know it's not easy.

But if Jesus did it this way, it means that this approach is very important.

We can do this if we will just allow our hearts to be filled with Jesus Love.
