# Let The Journey Begin

Over the past few weeks, I've been reflecting about my way of living as a Christian.

It's been more than 6 years now since I made the best decision of my life.

To be born again spiritually.

However, over the course of this journey, I may have been running for the sake of running the race.

I think I needed to slow down and go back to my first love.

> â€œBut I have this complaint against you. You donâ€™t love me or each other as you did at first! Revelations 2:4 NLT

# Back To My First Love

Jesus Christ is was and is my first love.

Starting today, I'll be going back to reading the gospels where I can read the very words of my Lord and personal Savior.

As I meditate on every Words He says, I will try to seek out how Jesus displays His love.

And I will try to write about it if not everyday at least 90% of the week.

I have never been as excited as I am now.

Not when I was trying to do things on my own way. (Making apps)
