> 23 â€œSo if you are presenting a sacrifice at the altar in the Temple and you suddenly remember that someone has something against you, 24 leave your sacrifice there at the altar. Go and be reconciled to that person. Then come and offer your sacrifice to God. Matthew 5:23-34 NLT

## Where is the love?

One of the many reasons why we need to be planted in a local church is for us to have a place where we can express our worship to God by giving Him back what belongs to Him.

These could be in a form of tithes, vows, offerings or in this passage, it's called sacrifice.

However because we are used in doing this religiously, we tend to overlook what really matters before the eyes of God.

> But Samuel replied, â€œWhat is more pleasing to the LORD: your burnt offerings and sacrifices or your obedience to his voice? Listen! Obedience is better than sacrifice, and submission is better than offering the fat of rams. 1 Samuel 15:22 NLT

God wants our hearts to be free from any kinds of bondage first more than any offerings and sacrifices.

So if we suddenly remember someone that we are not in good terms with, God wants us to love first by reconciling to that person immediately.

Once done, we can now go back and continue our givings to God.

God don't need our money. Besides, everything we have comes from Him anyways.

God wants our loving hearts more than anything. ðŸ’–
