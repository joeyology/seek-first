## Where Is The Love?

It took me a while to write again because I suddenly find it hard to deal with the Law of Moses since I've started to dig deeper on how Jesus love.

Stoning to death anyone? Doesn't seem loving to me anymore.

Maybe during Moses' time this is acceptable because they seem to be living in Barbaric era.

However several years gone by and this was still being practiced religiously.

And then Jesus came not to abolish the law but to accomplish their purpose.

I honestly still don't understand and grasp the breadth of this thought but maybe having an example would help.

> 4 ‚ÄúTeacher,‚Äù they said to Jesus, ‚Äúthis woman was caught in the act of adultery. 5 The law of Moses says to stone her. What do you say?‚Äù John 8:4-5 NLT

> 7 They kept demanding an answer, so he stood up again and said, ‚ÄúAll right, but let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone!‚Äù John 8:7 NLT

In this example, did Jesus abolished the law of stoning to death?

I don't think so because He says, let the one who don't have sinned be the first to throw a stone.

So how did Jesus accomplished the purpose of this law?

I still don't know. I think it's love.

I think Jesus accomplished the purpose of this law by going to the  heart of people without them knowing it.

I think Jesus knew that there is love in every hearts of people.

It's just that being religious to the law chained the love that hinders people from loving one another.

And that's where I found Jesus love. üíñ
