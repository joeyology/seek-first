# Where Is The Love?

Jesus traveled, teach, preach & heals.

For me, it was all an act of giving.

Jesus didn't ask for anything back.

This shows that our God is a giver.

Through this, I realized that giving without asking for anything in return is a way of loving.

Where there is love, we draw closer to it.

And crowds followed Jesus since then.
