## What's on my mind?

I just finished my 5th Adalo project in which I've only started using just a week ago. And I think it's pretty impressive.

It goes to show that Adalo has something in it that can help a non hard core programmer like me to ship faster.

### What makes Adalo special?

Based from my approximately 2 weeks of continuous building with Adalo, I say that it's their amazing editor.

It's not perfect yet but it can deliver nonetheless.

### However...

However, after building my 5th project, I feel like I'm just repeating myself over and over again.

There are features that aren't there yet as of this writing but I'm sure that they are working very hard to make Adalo better than ever.

Refer to their [**roadmap**](https://ideas.adalo.com/).

### Conclusion

Personally, I'm 100% in support with [**Adalo**](https://www.adalo.com/)!

You have a wonderful product, Adalo Team! May God bless you and give you more wisdom and success! 🙏

I think I'm just tired of hustling with their [**#NoCodeConnectsUs Challenge**](https://www.nucode.co/challenge/the-nocodeconnectsus-challenge-1585655164419x599472269787660300). Hoping to win the grand prize!
