excerpt: It seem unloving to take my eye and throw it away just because I look lustfully
  at someone.  It also seem unloving to cut off my hand and throw it away either when
  it caused me to sin.

> 29 So if your eye—even your good eye—causes you to lust, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 30 And if your hand—even your stronger hand—causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.

## Where is the love?

It seem unloving to take my eye and throw it away just because I look lustfully at someone.

It also seem unloving to cut off my hand and throw it away either when it caused me to sin.

But when Jesus said these radical things to me, that's where I found His great love for me the most.

Jesus knew that keeping a life living in sin is the one way ticket to hell.

And Jesus won't let that happen to those He love.

That's why even if it seems extreme and radical and would cause me to hurt my feelings, He taught these hard truths anyway.

I think that's what real love is all about.

Even if it would hurt our loved one's feelings, let's choose to share Jesus no matter how hard it may be for us.

If heaven is real, so is hell. ⚡
