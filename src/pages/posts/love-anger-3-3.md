> 25 â€œWhen you are on the way to court with your adversary, settle your differences quickly. Otherwise, your accuser may hand you over to the judge, who will hand you over to an officer, and you will be thrown into prison. 26 And if that happens, you surely wonâ€™t be free again until you have paid the last penny. Matthew 5:25-26 NLT

## Where is the love?

Anger is dangerous.

It could overpower mercy and love for a moment.

That's why an angry person can suddenly do unimaginable thing subconsciously realizing later that it's all because of the great anger inside.

And Jesus knew everything about man.

If we knew we have enemies, don't feed the anger by delaying because what we feed grows.

So to prevent this from happening, Jesus wants us to settle our differences quickly with our enemy to conquer sudden anger and unnecessary actions with great love.
