## Reality

I’m at a point in my life where there’s not much progress going on.

Which is something that I am not proud of.

But I have hope.

> 'For I know the plans I have for you,” says the Lord . “They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. ' Jeremiah 29:11 NLT

I have hope in God who holds our future.

For now, I will pause. Meditate. And be devotional.

I will write down my reality (work-life integration) in this newsletter.

## Expectations

I expect that through this new methodology, I’ll be able to develop my way of thinking and writing skills.

To those who will subscribe, expect a mix of topics in the area of my professional work, my spiritual journey as a Christian and my attempts in making a company of my own.
