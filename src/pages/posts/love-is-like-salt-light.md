> '“You are the salt of the earth. But what good is salt if it has lost its flavor? Can you make it salty again? It will be thrown out and trampled underfoot as worthless. “You are the light of the world—like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden. No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket. Instead, a lamp is placed on a stand, where it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father.' Matthew 5:13-16 NLT

## Where Is The Love?

Jesus loves teaching through analogy.

He used salt to let us know that we should strive and work hard in maintaining our Christianity. Otherwise, it will be hard to impossible to get it back again.

He used light for us to understand that we are meant to shine and not to hide the brightness. Otherwise, it will be useless.

I think it is the same with love.

If we say we love but we are not using and showing it, then there's no point in loving.

## Application

We should love like salt & light.

We need to ask God to help us keep love in our hearts and to be loving in this world.
